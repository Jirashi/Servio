# Servio - Smart Converter

## 🔁 What is Servio?
Servio is an All-in-One unit converter. Using Servio's smart formula, you can convert **200+** units in **16** measurements. 

## 🤔 What makes Servio different?
Instead of writing every formula manually for every unit, I made a single formula to do all the work for me. This way I could add units faster and make the code simpler. The only disadvantage is you lose some accuracy when converting one unit to another *and then* converting it to the desired unit*.

### 🧠 The Formula
```
(x / z) * y
```

For example 1 Foot to Inches:
x = 1, y = 0.3048 (1 foot = 0.3048 meters, for length meter is the base unit), z = 0.0254 (1 inch = 0.0254 meters)
`(1 / 0.0254) *  0.3048 = 12`
